<h3 align="center" >ABSTRACT</h3>

The main purpose of the student information system is a management information system for education establishments to manage student data. In the current system, all the activities are done manually. It is very time-consuming and costly. Our student management system deals with the various activities related to the students. For every college of the important task for the people administration department is to manage student data information details in a procedure-oriented system manner with of latest information updates for every year which need to be available for easy access. To provide this service, we designed a simple follow of the student’s information role management system enter project which has various modules which are helpful for the student administration to efficiently faculty manage the students’ details. keywords: - student information, attendance, timetable, academic calendar, contacts.

This site use to provide service 24*7 by just entering the required details of the user and also the information of the user was 100% secure and administrative. That was open by only the user or by the department. It provides day-to-day information after uploading by management and it was very easy to use on your Browser. I will also connect to your faculty of the departments so we create a different password or Id for the faculty or management of your department.

 <h3 align="center" >INTRODUCTION</h3>


Most students do position have the right information about their course, wrens a post able to take lectures want help from others who have information about the courses, or want to get help with assignments from their fellows. I want to create a solution for the students to have one portal where they can share their lecture and assignment information. they can communicate with their alumni & post and get the takes information about different opportunities course material books and notes.

This prevents any anonymous person to enter the system and mishandle the records. It is better than the manual methods as they do not have any security measures of who can access the system and who cannot.

the student information management system is a management information system for education establishments to manage student data.

Department can also able to differentiate the assignment into various categories like quizzes, essays, or report writing. This helps in making the studies more vibrant for the students.
This module is one of the essential parts of the system as this will act as the official document of 
students’ presence in the institution. it will show the attendance of the students in every course.

<h3 align="center" >LITERATURE REVIEW</h3>

   The software of the project is a time-consuming, extremely people-intensive effort, with a fundamental effect on my different teams' work and results. The project's success relies heavily on the timely transfer of knowledge between participating parties, such as the management team, department heads, developers, and customers. In the current situation, most software companies work concurrently on many projects, which means that an effective project management procedure is required for the allocation of resources and project planning. Web-based project coordination, monitoring, and management system offer a solution for automating project management functionalities, including document management, resources management, and team collaboration, which encompasses all facets of the project management process. The framework includes features including assessing real progress, team coordination, updating email reviews and short messages, server login management, customer portfolio management, and online payment invoices, as well as providing management reports that contribute to successful decision-making.


     This paper uses an object-oriented research methodology for modeling design and    construction details. In a previous review, an approach was suggested to combine design-building processes based on knowledge processing and modeling. By splitting the comprehensive information of the project into groups of related information, construction-related issues were identified and then followed up on their respective design processes.

 This paper illustrates this process using a relatively young and modern research tool
 rather than a conventional formal approach. To model the knowledge in terms of the
 basic concepts underlying object-oriented analysis (OOO) approach was implemented. 
A full OOA model was built through the five main activities of Coad and Yourdon’s OOA
       system with the potential to enhance construction issues.
