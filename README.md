The project solves real-life problems. The easily handle the explain in a work to proceed to control a crime in a decentralized server the server is my website that holds five or six school’s data to maintain the work on it link schools to better management.
The future to update a tracking id card system is used in a project the one center main/source a server to manage data the content with another system.
Some are too aware of this program the team solves some problems. In time the easiest to maintain whole properties.

o	The organized website for displaying information about students and some issues to handle students just as fees-related problems, attendance, and getting information from the department.

o	Fresher students have some hesitation and doubts about his/her institution this site can help and support them by contacting some seniors they can resolve it.

o	Visual contact with a senior also medium to solve a problem, they can guide his/her problem like his, or their guardians.

o	This site can solve many problems in an information management student’s life and other professional areas.

o	Artificial intelligence-based software has the power to eliminate biased admission to schools by up to 80%.

o	The issues of record-keeping and management at school are decreased by 75% by implementing technology in schools.

o	More than 44 universities (public and private) outsource the data collection and analysis to different firms.

It is very time-consuming and costly. Our student management system deals with the various activities related to the students. For every college of the important task for the people administration department is to manage student data information of details in a procedure-oriented system manner with of latest information updates for every year which need to be available for easy access.

<h3 align="center" >LITERATURE REVIEW</h3>

   The software of the project is a time-consuming, extremely people-intensive effort, with a fundamental effect on my different teams' work and results. The project's success relies heavily on the timely transfer of knowledge between participating parties, such as the management team, department heads, developers, and customers. In the current situation, most software companies work concurrently on many projects, which means that an effective project management procedure is required for the allocation of resources and project planning. Web-based project coordination, monitoring, and management system offer a solution for automating project management functionalities, including document management, resources management, and team collaboration, which encompasses all facets of the project management process. The framework includes features including assessing real progress, team coordination, updating email reviews and short messages, server login management, customer portfolio management, and online payment invoices, as well as providing management reports that contribute to successful decision-making.


     This paper uses an object-oriented research methodology for modeling design and    construction details. In a previous review, an approach was suggested to combine design-building processes based on knowledge processing and modeling. By splitting the comprehensive information of the project into groups of related information, construction-related issues were identified and then followed up on their respective design processes.

 This paper illustrates this process using a relatively young and modern research tool
 rather than a conventional formal approach. To model the knowledge in terms of the
 basic concepts underlying object-oriented analysis (OOO) approach was implemented. 
A full OOA model was built through the five main activities of Coad and Yourdon’s OOA
       system with the potential to enhance construction issues.
